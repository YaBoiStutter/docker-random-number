# docker-random-number
A docker container what hosts a webpage to randomly select a number between 2 numbers.

Example hosted here: https://randomnumber.charva.co.uk/

This was purely made as a generator for port numbers for docker. I may eventually flush this out into a nice little soultion but tbh, this is basically a learning exercise for myself
